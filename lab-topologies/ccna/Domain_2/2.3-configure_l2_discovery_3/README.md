# Configure and verify Layer 2 discovery protocols (Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP)

CML Version used: 2.7.0+build.4

    CDP and LLDP are like friendly messages that network devices send to each other to introduce themselves and share information.
    CDP is like a postcard that Cisco devices use to say "Hello, I'm a Cisco device!" It also tells other Cisco devices nearby about its name, the type of device it is, and how it's connected.
    LLDP is similar, but it's like a universal postcard that all kinds of devices can use. It sends out messages saying "Hi, I'm here!" and shares basic information about the device, like its name, what it is, and how it's connected to the network.
    So, CDP and LLDP are both ways for devices on a network to be friendly and introduce themselves, helping to keep everything connected smoothly.
