# Interpret basic operations of Rapid PVST+ Spanning Tree Protocol

Created with CML2.7 (IOL-L2). N.B. This case is derived from a real case from which all real data have been changed. The purpose of this lab is to help design the network redundancy with PVRSTP and configure it in the lab. Lab context : Three Towns : Bourgueil, Chinon and Souzay have gathered their IT with a bigger one : Saumur. As cities they are entitled to lay optical fibers within their territory. Currently they have lonly one fiber optic sheath between them with several optical fibers. The three towns are connected directly to saumur by three fibers. Now they want redundancy in their network : 1) they want to use 2 fibers from the first sheath to connect neighbor spoke towns, 2) the network admin wants to avoid all of the towns to be isolated in case its sheath be striken and cut by an excavator. So he wants to lay a second fiber optic sheath between Souzay and Saumur. The network admin has chosen pvRSTP to design and configure redundancy
