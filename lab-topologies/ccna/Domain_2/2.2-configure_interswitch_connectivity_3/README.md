# Configure and verify interswitch connectivity

CML Version used: 2.7.0+build.4 Welcome to our lab on setting up connections between switches! We're going to learn about Interswitch Connectivity. Trunk Ports: Trunk ports are like highways between switches. They carry traffic from multiple VLANs (think of them as lanes on the highway) between switches. 802.1Q: This is a rule or a standard that tells switches how to send traffic between them. It's like a language they speak to understand each other. Native VLAN: Every trunk needs a lane for untagged traffic. This is like a special lane on the highway just for cars that don't have any stickers (tags) saying which VLAN they belong to. So in this lab, we'll set up trunk ports between switches, make sure they speak the same language (802.1Q), and have a special lane for untagged traffic. Ready to get started? Let's go connect some switches! notes: | #Task-2.2 step1: Configure Tunk port on switches so that their connectvity can establish between switches using tagging(802.1Q). step 2: Verify all configuration and connectvity. step 3: Change the native Vlan from vlan1 to Infra-Employees(vlan-30) step4: Verify the native status on ports.
