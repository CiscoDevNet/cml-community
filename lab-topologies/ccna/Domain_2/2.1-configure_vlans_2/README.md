# Configure and verify VLANs (normal range) spanning multiple switches

In this lab, I have created VLANs on both switches in the topology, assign VLANs to switch access ports,verify that VLANs are working as expected, and then create a VLAN trunk between the two switches to allow hosts in the same VLAN to communicate through the trunk, regardless of which switch the host is actually attached to. I used the SandboxDevnet CML. I am unsure how to verify the version, I believe its 2.X.
