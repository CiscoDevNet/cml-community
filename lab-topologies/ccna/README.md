# CCNA Exam Scenarios

In this directory you will find CML sample labs with a twist.  Each of these correspond to tasks one will see
in the [CCNA Exam Topics](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna-exam-topics) list.  Each one of these
labs comes in two forms: an initial scenario, and a solution.

In the Lab Notes of the initial scenario, you will find an exercise or set of exercises to complete around the
respective CCNA exam topic.  If you get stuck or want to see an example solution to the exercise(s) the solution
lab will be the same topology with the devices configured correctly.

**Good luck on your studies!**
