# Task 1.1 - Explain the role and function of network components 

CML Version used: 2.7.0+build.4

In this Lab, we'll explore the fundamental components of network infrastructure and their crucial roles in enabling seamless communication and data exchange. From routers directing internet traffic to access points providing wireless connectivity, we'll delve into the functions of Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches, next-generation firewalls, controllers like Cisco DNA Center and WLC, endpoints, servers, and Power over Ethernet technology. By understanding these components and their analogies to everyday scenarios, we'll gain insights into the intricate workings of networks and their significance in modern connectivity.
