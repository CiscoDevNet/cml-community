lab:
  description: In this Lab, we'll explore the fundamental components of network infrastructure
    and their crucial roles in enabling seamless communication and data exchange.
    From routers directing internet traffic to access points providing wireless connectivity,
    we'll delve into the functions of Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches, next-generation
    firewalls, controllers like Cisco DNA Center and WLC, endpoints, servers, and
    Power over Ethernet technology. By understanding these components and their analogies
    to everyday scenarios, we'll gain insights into the intricate workings of networks
    and their significance in modern connectivity.
