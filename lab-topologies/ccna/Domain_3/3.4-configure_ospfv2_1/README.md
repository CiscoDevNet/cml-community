# Configure and verify single area OSPFv2

OSPF, short for Open Shortest Path First, is like a GPS for routers in a network. It helps them figure out the shortest route between two places (endpoints) and the best path to take, considering all the routers in between. In this lab we will configure the OSPFv2 and ensure all devices are able to communicate with one another. CML Version 2.X (Sandbox Version)
