  notes: |
    DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) configuration is performed on routers to assign an IP address, subnet mask, gateway address= to the host systems. With this configuration, the dynamic IP address is assigned, which enables the administrator to easily connect a new host in the configured network.  In this lab we will configure R1 as the DHCP server for the network 192.168.1.0 /24.

    Step 1. Configure the hostnames as per the Topology.
    Note: Record the MAC Addresses for the hosts as this will be used for validation later.

    Step 2: On R1, create the DHCP pool labeled as “MyPool”.
    NOTE: The default router IP should be the IP address assigned to Gig/01 on R1.

    Step 3: Configure the interface connected to SW1to R1 as a Trunk port.
    Note: Don't forget to bring up the interface.

    Note: On each host, run the “ipconfig /renew”.
    Step 3: Verify that all three hosts have successfully received an IP Address from R1 via the: show ip dhcp binding command
    See the Output below on R1:
    R1#show ip dhcp binding
    Bindings from all pools not associated with VRF:
    IP address          Client-ID/              Lease expiration        Type
