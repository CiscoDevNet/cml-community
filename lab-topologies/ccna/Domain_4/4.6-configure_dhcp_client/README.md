# Configure and verify DHCP client and relay

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) configuration is performed on routers to assign an IP address, subnet mask, gateway address= to the host systems. With this configuration, the dynamic IP address is assigned, which enables the administrator to easily connect a new host in the configured network.  In this lab we will configure R1 as the DHCP server and verify its configuration.
