# CCNA Prep CML Resources
The CCNA Prep Program is a study resource put together by the Learning and Certifications team within Cisco to help engineers working towards earning their CCNA certification.  Each session dives into a topic from the CCNA blueprint, exploring it through a hands on/labs driven approach. These hands on labs are run on Cisco Modeling Labs and include full lab guides that can be used after the session for anyone to practice and hone their skills as they prepare for their CCNA Exam.  We are sharing the CML topology files with the CML Community for fun, learning and inspiration.
