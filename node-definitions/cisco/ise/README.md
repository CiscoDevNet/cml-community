# Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Node Definition

This directory contains a node definition for the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

### Image Availability

The image for ISE can be found at https://software.cisco.com/download/home/283801620/type/283802505/.  There is no specific
QCOW2 for ISE, however.  You can convert the OVA's VMDK to QCOW2 using the `qemu-img` command:

```sh
qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 ise.vmdk ise.qcow2
```

Or you can use libvirt's `virt-installer` to install the ISO to a QCOW2, and then copy that QCOW2 file to the CML server.

### Known Issues

Without a license, ISE provides a 90-day eval mode where all features are expected to work.  However, the resources
provided to the node are targeted to the small/eval deployment.  So large-scale management of devices and users will
not work without providing more CPUs and memory.
