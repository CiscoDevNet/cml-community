# Loading vMX Image Definitions

See the vMX [README](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/cml-community/tree/master/node-definitions/juniper/vmx/README.md) on how to properly load these images definitions.  

**Note:** new image definitions must be created from these files and loaded using the same process.  It is _not_ possible to create image definitions for vMX via the CML UI at this time.
